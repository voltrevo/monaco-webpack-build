# Monaco Webpack Build

This is a build of [monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) using webpack.

Monaco does complex stuff and consequently it usually needs to be tailored to different build environments. The idea here is to just provide the webpack build so that you can use it in your environment of choice.
