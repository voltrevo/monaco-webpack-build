# Monaco Webpack Build

This is a build of [monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) using
webpack.

Monaco does complex stuff and consequently it usually needs to be tailored to
different build environments. The idea here is to just provide the webpack build
so that you can use it in your environment of choice.

At the moment, this is just about making things work in packup. It's a hack, and
it might not help you.
